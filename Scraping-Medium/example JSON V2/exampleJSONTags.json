            "IoT addresses the challenge of inventory management for retailers. They can streamline the supply chain by monitoring supply and demand. IoT solutions cut costs and increase customer satisfaction levels by ensuring all products are stocked appropriately.\n",
            "Technologies such as RFID tags or beacons for proximity sensing allow automated stock monitoring to ensure nothing is out of stock. IoT solves inventory management by giving retailers enough data to forecast demand and scale up stock during peak periods.\n",
            "Checkout lines are often discouraging for visitors at a physical store and even compel retailers to employ more staff to manage busy hours.\n",
            "Retailers can save costs and make the process convenient while ensuring they do not lose any potential revenue by automating the checkout process for the sake of driving faster sales.\n",
            "Installing IoT-based automated point-of-sale (PoS) systems allows customers to self-checkout for those who do not want to wait in queues. The system reads tags on each product using NFC technology and charges the customer’s permitted account for the total amount.\n",
            "The sensor-based system provides a better customer experience and attracts consumers to shop hassle-free even when there is a time crunch.\n",
            "Retailers can use IoT for inventory management. Smart ordering based on demand and optimizing delivery routes makes the process efficient and cuts costs as well. Smart fulfillment allows retailers to ensure the right amount of product is in stock at all times.\n",
            "GPS-based tracking allows retailers to keep track of their shipments from the warehouse to the store shelves. Automated organization of pallets using IoT sensors and installing RFID tags on inventory saves time and money spent searching for particular products.\n",
            "Plus, IoT helps track issues with recalled products, which can potentially cause injuries and make consumers lose trust in brands. It is possible to track individual shipments of items rather than pull a much larger quantity of items that do not contain known defects.\n",
            "That way, it is possible to determine things like which supplier provided faulty parts while fulfilling the order or find out how the damage happened during shipping.\n",
            "A retail store’s layout can be optimized with the help of beacon technology for aisle analytics. However, it can also be used to send custom notifications for discounts or in-store promotions to consumers pretty smoothly.\n",
            "For instance, retailers can offer discounts tailored to buyer needs by using IoT solutions, thereby increasing conversion rates. Repeat buyers can be rewarded for their loyalty through these custom discount codes.\n",
            "Research suggests that 60% of shoppers are engaging with beacon-triggered content, and it even increases their likelihood of purchasing in-store. New customers can be attracted by setting up sensors around the store.\n",
            "These sensors track daily commuters and visitors to the specified areas around the retailer’s location. The system sends them personalized offers on their smartphones via text message or email, inviting them to try the products.\n",
            "IoT technology offers retailers the benefit of monitoring inventory from the warehouse until it arrives at the store. They can track any missing goods with ease and even track home deliveries in real time.\n",
            "GPS and RFID technology, coupled with IoT sensors, provide retailers with data such as traffic status, weather conditions, the health of inventory, and location. They can use the data for logistics management and route optimization.\n",
            "Connecting with vendors, carriers, and teams over the cloud eases collaboration and provides transparency. Drivers can be directly intimated for any required changes in routes. Similarly, RFID tags and beacon sensors can be deployed in-store to keep track of stock.\n",
            "The information can be used to replenish stock on time. It is also helpful to keep track of items and facilitate automated checkouts.\n",
            "Connected equipment in a warehouse, for instance, can help monitor movement across the facility, connected products can update real-time inventory, and connected workers can pick up orders efficiently and swiftly.\n",
            "The recent introduction of automated checkout systems, like Amazon Go, is revolutionizing the buying process. It enables customers to walk in and out of retail stores. They no longer need to get cash for payment or swipe a credit card.\n",
            "High-tech sensors installed at the exit automatically charge all purchases, thus saving time. Automating checkout eliminates having any checkout lines or waiting times at billing counters.\n",
            "Additionally, implementing predictive technology allows retailers to predict when more people will purchase goods and what to stock more of. They can use the information to appropriately stock shelves and vending machines.\n",
            "The way IoT reduces costs varies by industry. In eCommerce, IoT saves money by reducing overall maintenance costs, bridging the gap between floor workers and warehouse managers, identifying and resolving bottlenecks in production, and so on. In this section, we will drill down further into examples of specific cost-saving use cases of IoT in eCommerce:\n",
            "IoT offers end-to-end visibility in terms of inventory management. It helps reduce inventory storage costs and control losses due to delays. Retailers can also keep track of product quality in the case of consumables and fresh food items.\n",
            "Predictive analytics track the demand for products in specified periods. Retailers can stock the items as per demand and manage operational costs.\n",
            "Yes, they provide data that helps in improving stock placement to promote sales. They also automatically initiate order requests to replenish stock. It ensures that in-demand products are never out of stock and are placed at strategic spots.\n",
            "IoT reduces losses due to fraud by offering traceability and visibility of inventory through the delivery process. Sensors, for instance, can monitor the movement of a specific order from start to finish with complete ease.\n",
            "They can cut down on the workload of in-store employees, allowing them to engage in more meaningful and complex tasks. More straightforward jobs, such as helping customers find specific products and replacing misplaced items, are efficiently handled by robots. What a time to be alive!\n",
            "Automating processes such as checkout helps reduce costs and save time. McKinsey estimates 75% cost savings with automated checkout. A reduction in the requirement for cashier staff in 2025 may result in savings of $150 billion to $380 billion a year. Those are some massive cost savings!\n",
            "The multi-tenant feature offers retailers the convenience of managing multiple entities on one platform. They can provide each user or tenant access to specific devices. This role-based authorization helps save costs and resources by avoiding unnecessary expenses associated with setting up separate platforms for each entity.\n",
            "The use of IoT devices and sensor-backed technology in retail is the way forward for retail businesses. However, retail businesses are struggling with the amount of data that is being collected from IoT devices. This is a common problem with IoT across domains.\n",
            "You see, retail executives do not have enough skills or qualifications to gain valuable insights from the data. The information often becomes overwhelming for them and thus calls for efficient data management. Here is how that can help:\n",
            "The retailers, in turn, can identify opportunities and prospects to act on them. A comparative analysis will give as understanding of their current and past usage and help them make business decisions accordingly.\n",
            "Retailers are always looking for ways to improve their customer’s experience and increase business. Implementing IoT solutions into stores helps them convert more customers into loyal shoppers, and for a good reason.\n",
            "Gaining valuable insights on demand patterns provides retailers with enough information to understand their target audience. They can use it to design better business strategies to promote a higher level of engagement.\n",
            "If you are looking to change how you are running things at your eCommerce firm, now is the time to give it a facelift with IoT and partner with someone who can help you achieve your business objectives.\n",
            "Having said that, why not have a consultation with our team, which is an expert in IoT eCommerce app development and has worked on numerous projects before?\n",

            "Last August 18–20, 2023 I intended to join Australia’s GovHack 2023(https://govhack.org/) hackathon but because I had other commitments at that time, I had to give it a pass again this year.\n",
            "My idea was to create something related to IoT since I am working with IoT data on my day job. I know there will be some open datasets for IoT based on past hackathons. After the event, I browsed through the datasets and luckily enough I found an interesting dataset. Brisbane City Council uploaded the telemetry sensors data for rainfall and stream heights( https://www.data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/data/dataset/telemetry-sensors-rainfall-and-stream-heights). I thought this would be a great starting point for my IoT platform idea.\n",
            "Building a platform from scratch is hard enough much more using a modern tech stack that I have not used before. So, my plan is to make it as simple as possible to make it into a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) where I can then make it robust in the future. So here are the technologies that I chose to use for this project. What is so great about these tools is that I can write all my code in Python which is very common nowadays in the data world.\n",
            "At the end of the project, this is what we can see from the dashboard\n",
            "Upon quick investigation of the dataset site, I found out that there are two CSV files, one contains the metadata of the sensors themselves ( id, type, geolocation, measurement unit, etc), and the other the actual sensor readings for every 15 minutes collected from the device — this file is in wide format CSV where the columns are the sensor_ids and a timestamp and contains the readings for the past 24-hours with 10-mins windows. The figure below might explain better what the file I get looks like.\n",
            "From the looks of it, I know I will have multiple duplicate records if I just blindly process and append the records to my raw table. So to minimize this duplication I need to clean them first before inserting them into the DuckDB table. But first I have to extract them from the dataset portal. To do that I just have to grab the download URL from the website and then use a Python script to download it.\n",
            "To deploy this to your local environment, you have to start first your local Prefect server. You will need to install Prefect first using ‘pip’ or any Python package manager you have.\n",
            "Now we can deploy our extract flow like this with parameters\n",
            "Yes! Our flow is now scheduled to be executed every 15 minutes. Prefect will handle all the flow scheduling and execution for us now. If you want to monitor this from the UI you can now head to http://127.0.0.1:4200/\n",
            "To be able to analyse the data we extracted from the Council website we needed a place where we can store them — this is where DuckDB comes in.\n",
            "I decided beforehand that I would use a persistent DuckDB instead of the in-session memory so I could save the records in a relation state rather than reading multiples again. In this way, I can append new raw data that comes in and record in an audit table the last insert timestamp that the task processed.\n",
            "To create the tables in my DuckDB instance, I downloaded multiple sample files from the source and then wrote a one-off Prefect flow to seed the database taking advantage of DuckDB’s auto-creation of tables from reading a CSV file. The sample code below lets me populate my database.\n",
            "In order to avoid duplicate records, I checked for the last_datetime I recorded in an audit table and then just read the records from the current data frame that has the last_datetime after the last recorded last_datetime. To ensure it is processing the correct order of files. I have sorted the list of filenames before parsing them.\n",
            "With that, I was able to create my database now.\n",
            "To explore my database, I installed the no-dependencies duckdb cli binary.\n",
            "I intentionally put the binary file inside my project folder for convenient access to my duckdb file.\n",
            "To use this cli, it is similar to any SQL console application out there. You use the familiar SQL commands to display and query tables.\n",
            "In order to open a persistent database you should this command below :\n",

            "As we all know, alcoholic products have always been popular around the world as high-value-added commodities. However, the alcohol market is also faced with the proliferation of counterfeit and shoddy products, which poses a serious threat to brand reputation and consumer trust. To cope with this challenge, the wine industry is increasingly inclined to use RFID technology to improve anti-counterfeiting and traceability capabilities to ensure that the quality and authenticity of wine products can be checked. So compared with the anti-counterfeiting traceability in the existing market, what advantages does RFID have?\n",
            "​\n",
            "In terms of anti-counterfeiting. RFID tags can help wineries and retailers quickly verify product authenticity. Consumers and retailers simply use an RFID reader to scan the label on the wine bottle to obtain detailed information about the wine, including production date, batch information, and brand confirmation. Prevent unauthorized seal replacement by integrating RFID tags into the wine bottle’s seal. If someone attempts to open or replace the seal, the system will automatically sound an alarm, thereby reducing the risk of counterfeit products. At the same time, RFID technology allows wineries to track the flow of products from the production line to the hands of consumers. This traceability helps identify problems in the supply chain and take action more quickly.\n",
            "In terms of traceability. RFID tags can be used to track wine raw materials such as grapes, malt, and yeast. This helps ensure the quality and origin of ingredients, thereby improving the quality of the wine. While the finished wine is still being brewed, RFID technology can be used to monitor temperature, humidity, and other production parameters. If an abnormality occurs, the system can sound an alarm to ensure the stability and quality of the production process. At the same time, by attaching RFID tags to wine bottles, wine can be quality controlled throughout the supply chain. From the distillery to the warehouse to the retailer, the condition of the wine can be tracked to ensure the product is stored and shipped in the right environment.\n",
            "For the finished wine industry. Using RFID technology to enhance anti-counterfeiting and traceability capabilities can increase consumers’ trust in products. Consumers know they are buying genuine products and not fake products. At the same time, RFID technology can also help reduce inventory losses and economic losses caused by counterfeit and shoddy products. The wine industry can manage inventory more efficiently and improve product safety. In addition, RFID technology provides real-time visibility in the supply chain, helping to improve inventory management and transportation efficiency. This helps reduce supply chain costs and improve responsiveness. Finally, wineries using RFID technology can more easily comply with regulatory requirements and ensure product quality and safety.\n",
            "Overall, RFID technology has great potential in wine anti-counterfeiting and traceability. It can not only improve the quality and safety of wine products but also help the wine industry reduce losses, improve supply chain efficiency, and enhance consumer trust. As technology continues to develop, RFID technology is expected to play an increasingly important role in the wine industry, bringing more innovations and benefits to the industry. The wine industry should actively explore the application of RFID technology to meet increasingly stringent market requirements and ensure the traceability and authenticity of wine products.\n",

            "Today we will be developing a simple flutter App using Dart and Android studio, but first let’s revise on the the terminologies..\n",
            "Flutter is a software development kit (SDK) for creating high-performance, high-fidelity apps from a single Dart Language codebase for iOS, Android, Web (beta), and desktop (technical preview).\n",
            "After installing Android studio and plugins, Android studio’s welcome screen appears when it starts. First Flutter app will run while Android Studio downloads some extra software.\n",
            "Dart offers the language and runtimes that underpin Flutter apps, but Dart also supports several essential developer tasks like coding, code analysis, and testing. The static type checking feature of the type-safe Dart language makes sure that a variable’s value always corresponds to the variable’s static type.\n",
            "Using a simple wizard, developers may start new Flutter projects in Android Studio. Let’s get going!\n",
            "From the welcome page, select New Flutter Project, or from the File menu, select New and then New Flutter Project. After selecting Start a New Flutter Project, three dialogue boxes will appear one after the other. The first asks what kind of Flutter project you want to make, the second for the name and other specifics of the newly created app, and the third for the creation of a project.\n",
            "The New Project dialogue box will appear in Android Studio. Click on the new flutter project icon.\n",
            "Enter Flutter SDK path in the appropriate field. If you still can’t find it, look for a “flutter” folder on your computer’s hard drive. Verify the directory path to your Flutter SDK in Android Studio. Click the Next button after making sure the path is accurate.\n",
            "The project is created by Android Studio, which then asks the user to open it. All the tools and widgets you need to create outstanding Flutter applications are available in the main window. The coding for the app building is done in this main window.\n",
            "The primary window of Android Studio could appear intimidating at first. In the top-left corner of the main window for Android Studio, you’ll see two crucial components:\n",
            "· The text is shown in the Target Selector.\n",
            "· The Run icon is a little green arrow that points to the right.\n",
            "The developer’s computer development and development objectives will determine what to do next.\n",
            "We use the Dart programming language to create Flutter code. All Dart files have the extension .dart at the end. There is a file named main.dart in the lib folder of our produced Flutter app. Clicking on the file will allow us to view it. Each Flutter application begins with the main() function. It’s located in the main.dart file. After all the coding is done, the app is ready to be tested.\n",
            "The Chrome (web) browser is the initial target we choose when executing the app. When selecting different targets like the iOS Simulator or Android Emulator, we will use this drop-down menu.\n",
            "The project can then be started by pressing the play button. The browser will launch our software in a brand-new window. Test it out!\n",
            "Hit the stop button in the Android studio to stop the app.\n",
            "To run an iPhone simulator on a Mac, choose Open iOS Simulator from the Target Selector drop-down menu. Choose Tools>AVD Manager from the main menu bar of Android Studio if you don’t have a Mac or if you wish to run an Android emulator. Search for a Green Arrow icon on the dialogue box’s right side when it appears. Click on the Green Arrow symbol.\n",
            "You must establish an Android Virtual Device if the AVD manager is empty, that is, if it does not already display a virtual device. Android Virtual Devices can take a while to launch. A PC with 16 gigabytes of RAM can take two to three minutes to boot up. The AVD might not launch on a PC with less than 4 GB of RAM.\n",
            "On Android Studio’s toolbar, select the Run icon. As a result, the Run tool window for Android Studio shows in the lower part of the main window.\n",
            "Widgets that will be used to create “Hello Flutter” app are:\n",
            "1. Stateless widget: Stateless Widgets in Flutter are widgets that cannot modify their state; in Stateless Widget, a method (function) called build that is only called once oversees drawing components on the screen. A new instance of the stateless widget must be created to redraw a stateless widget.\n",
            "2. MaterialApp widget: It is also a widget made available by the Flutter Team that adheres to the Google Material Design Scheme. The MaterialApp class contains a number of named arguments, such as home, where widget can be passed that will be displayed on an app’s home screen.\n",
            "3. Centre widget: Another preconfigured widget from Flutter Team is called Centre, and it accepts another widget as a child argument. As the name implies, Centre Widget will display Widget in its child argument.\n",
            "4. Text widget: The text widget, which is used to display text, is also predefined by Flutter Team.\n",
            "Import the package ‘package:flutter/material.dart’ at the beginning of the code, it has definitions for all the widgets used. “Build” method oversees painting components on the screen. It accepts a Build Context parameter that specifies which widgets should be painted on the screen first and in what sequence.\n",
            "The Stateless Widget-extending class ‘TestApp’ is essentially our “Hello Flutter” app’s primary widget tree. The build method, which returns a MaterialApp widget, comes after all of this. Next, MaterialApp’s home property is used, which is holding the Scaffold widget. The entire app screen is contained by the Scaffold widget. The appBar property, which accepts the AppBar widget as the object, has been utilised. In turn, the AppBar widget is holding the title “Test App” in place. The body is the following item, which is a MaterialApp property. The text widget with the message “Hello Flutter!” is the Center’s child and the object of the body.\n",
            "The output of the code displaying the simple “Hello Flutter!” test app, using Android Studio is displayed as below:\n",

            "You have probably heard that term. It is catching on fast and is setting the path that is followed by technological advancements today. There are Internet of Things (IoT) applications for almost every imaginable function on the ground. So, what exactly are these applications?\n",
            "IoT applications help you control all electronic devices in any place right from your current location. You can control your computers, automated doors, security systems, and much more with a customized IoT application.\n",
            "However, these applications control systems that are visible front of you. What about those in the air? In fact, Customized IoT applications can be used to address major planning, maintenance and fuel saving problems that commercial airlines are currently facing. They can even serve the purpose of Identifying design flaws and capture usage data to rapidly fix issues of poor quality.\n",
            "An aircraft’s management can improve its standards of safety by forecasting scheduled maintenance as well as by generating a detailed list showing all the components that are due for maintenance. The right steps will be taken at the right time and you will be prepared for it.\n",
            "Your aircraft’s performances and fuel efficiency will obviously improve with timely maintenance. The snags in particular components can be identified and also fixed immediately so that they do not cause any unforeseen problems.\n",
            "Predictive maintenance extends the lifespan of airplanes by fixing problems before they further erode the main system. In turn, this would mean an increased number of your fleet would still be flying instead of lying unattended in the hangar. You earn more revenue and also keep your customers satisfied. How? Flights won’t be delayed anymore due to repairs!\n",
            "Flight paths used in commercial aviation are overseen by government entities such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in the European Union. These agencies take several factors into account while determining the safest paths. Some of these factors are climate, avoiding war-zones and the abilities of the aircraft.\n",
            "Air traffic control agencies take these tasks seriously and generate outstanding reports. But aren’t they still on ground? How can they receive instantaneous data from planes that are in flight? It is possible with the use of airplane sensors run on Internet of Things (IoT). For example, these sensors could provide information about changes in pressure and temperature, or levels and intensity of turbulence.\n",
            "In summary, IoT quantifies and catalogs a larger span of data sets and at a more efficient speed than humans could ever do manually. Information such as turbulence or bad weather can be immediately reported from sensors on the affected plane to flight-path management agencies.\n"

            "Simply forecasting equipment faults, lowering operational costs, and having significant consequences for industries like manufacturing and transportation, predictive maintenance is transforming many different industries. It uses analytics, machine learning, and IoT.\n",
            "What is Predictive maintenance?\n",
            "Predictive maintenance uses data-driven insights to identify when machinery or equipment is most likely to break down. Predictive maintenance seeks to optimize maintenance chores by reviewing real-time data, as opposed to reactive maintenance, which tackles problems only after they arise, or preventive maintenance, which adheres to a set timetable. This preventative approach not only reduces downtime but also increases equipment longevity.\n",
            "Key Components\n",
            "Sensors and IoT Devices: The integration of sensors and IoT devices is crucial for predictive maintenance. These devices gather and send real-time data on things like temperature, vibration, and pressure to give a complete picture of the condition of the machinery.\n",
            "Condition Monitoring: A vital part of predictive maintenance is condition monitoring. It entails ongoing, real-time monitoring of equipment conditions. Manufacturers may detect minor shifts that might signal a possible problem before it becomes worse by monitoring a variety of metrics.\n",
            "Advanced Analytics and Machine Learning Techniques are then used to process the data that the sensors have collected. By identifying trends, abnormalities, and probable failure areas, these algorithms provide precise forecasts of when maintenance is necessary.\n",
            "Benefits\n",
            "Cost Savings: This is arguably the most important benefit of predictive maintenance. Businesses may significantly cut costs by avoiding costly repairs and downtime by addressing problems before they become breakdowns.\n",
            "Increased Equipment longevity: Predictive maintenance improves in maximizing the performance and longevity of equipment in addition to preventing unexpected failures.\n",
            "Longer Equipment Lifespan: In addition to reducing unplanned breakdowns, predictive maintenance increases equipment performance and lifetime.\n",
            "Safety Improves because routine maintenance lessens the likelihood of accidents and raises standard workplace safety. Businesses may handle possible safety issues with predictive maintenance before they become serious, guaranteeing a secure working environment.\n",
            "Considerations\n",
            "Data Security and Privacy: As data and connection are used more often, privacy and data security issues have grown. Businesses that employ predictive maintenance systems must give strong cybersecurity protection a first priority.\n",
            "Knowledge and Skill Gap: Using predictive maintenance demands a team knowledgeable in data analytics and machine learning.\n",
            "Utilizing data, analytics, and technology, predictive maintenance is revolutionizing businesses by ensuring optimal performance, lower costs, and increased safety. Technology will develop into an essential tool for enterprises to stay ahead in a competitive marketplace.\n"

            "Este artigo tem como finalidade compartilhar o desenvolvimento de um Aplicativo que atua com o Interruptor Sonoff para Ativar e Desativar a luz. Meu primeiro projeto complexo feito totalmente por mim.\n",
            "Pensei em fazer um Aplicativo para controlar o interruptor Sonoff que tenho no meu quarto, a primeira pesquisa já resultou em alguns artigos sobre, porém era necessário trocar o Firmware do IoT para ter a conexão MQTT e como aqui ele já funciona muito bem, preferi não arriscar. Depois de mais um tempo procurando descobri a biblioteca API eWeLink para JavaScript, mas como poderia fazer meu aplicativo Flutter se comunicar com ela?\n",
            "Lembrei de algumas aulas e projetos que fiz, então resolvi me aventurar com o Express em Node.js para fazer essa comunicação via API.\n",
            "Com certeza foi a melhor decisão que fiz.\n",
            "Fiz um arquivo onde há a conexão com a biblioteca da API eWeLink (foi a parte que mais demorei em uma atividade por conta da API estar com algumas falhas de autenticação e eu só descobri depois de ler algumas PRs e Discussões no repositório deles) e a utilização das funções fornecidas por ela para realizar as funções necessárias.\n",
            "Importei essas funções para um arquivo ‘server.js’, para começar o desenvolvimento da API. Então criei os endPoints para método GET, que executam as funções importadas.Por conta de ser um espelho com 3 interruptores, eu teria que passar o número deles, porém para isso não ficar complexo, fiz um objeto para associar o número com o nome da Luz. Para isso, fiz um parâmetro no endPoint de ativar/desativar a luz. Houve alguns tratamentos com o retorno nativo, pois eu apenas necessitava do status dos interruptores como resposta.\n",
            "O outro endPoint feito foi o de status dos botões do interruptor, tendo como parâmetro o ID do meu IoT (Deixei tudo dinâmico, para treinar e deixar algo mais próximo da realidade). A resposta desse endPoint foi customizada para que incluísse uma chave com valor do nome da Luz, para ser consumido no Flutter.\n",
            "Claro que esse processo não foi tão simples como está descrito, porém fui testando com o Postman, pesquisando como ajustar as respostas até chegar ao necessário.E então cheguei nessa resposta para o changeSwitch:\n",
            "e para o getDevice:\n",
            "O primeiro passo foi trazer o package ‘http’ e testá-lo, pois não tinha usado na prática. Após ver que estava funcionando, parti para a listagem dos botões correspondentes aos botões do Interruptor.\n",
            "Para essa atividade usei o GridView.builder, onde posso criar a quantidade de acordo com uma varíavel que atribui o tamanho da resposta da API, e ainda utilizar index para deixar cada um único.\n",
            "Nas funções assíncronas criadas, chamei a API de status do Device e atribui valores para as variáveis. Esse processo foi demorado por conta de ir descobrindo cada vez mais coisas que poderia deixar dinâmico. Utilizei essa técnica para ter a quantidade de botões, nome da Luz (aquela inclusão de chave-valor personalizada que fiz na resposta do endPoint), o status delas (tanto para iniciar o aplicativo tendo um feedback ao vivo de como estão as luzes, para recarregar e para alterar entre ‘Ativado’/‘Desativado’ e o Icon). E para a API de Ativar ou Desativar a Luz, ela apenas é requisitada com o parâmetro do nome da Luz, que foi recebida pelo status do outro endPoint, no onPressed dos botões passando o index.\n",
            "Após ver que realmente as luzes estavam acendendo/apagando, tudo muito bem funcional. Fui pensando nas boas maneiras de deixar melhor a experiência do usuário.\n",
            "Como por exemplo:O Icon e o texto de status da luz, apenas muda depois de realmente ter feita a alteração, por meio de assincronismo.\n",
            "Tela de carregamento, e opção de recarregar a tela. (CircularProgressIndicator, RefreshIndicator)\n",
            "Ter tratativas de erros para tudo, para o usuário. Então erro de carregamento inicial, erro ao recarregar a página. (Exemplo acima)Erro de acionar o botão.(SnackBar)\n",
            "E para finalizar, fiquei com uma pulga atrás da orelha, para ter uma tela de início de aplicativo, e para minha sorte, no BootCamp do Santander com a DIO, estava próximo dessa aula. Então aproveitei para utilizar algumas das técnicas apresentadas, junto a documentação do Flutter.\n",
            "Muito obrigado por chegar até aqui, o artigo resume bem o que foi o desenvolvimento. Caso queira ver todo o código, o link do repositório está abaixo. Fique a vontade para entrar em contato comigo para propor melhorias, tirar dúvidas ou para colaborações.\n",
